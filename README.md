Flappy Bird in Python


Hello,
This is my first project I am uploading to github.
It is a simple flappy bird project built in python.
This was mostly to implement some basics of OOP and expand my knowledge with tkinter. 
I know some places where code could be optimized and might come back and implement said opitimization or add more features. 
This is really just a project I did for fun and to help me get even more comfortable with python.

Thank you to anyone who reads this.
